This code contains the binary classification of the diabetic retinopathy image dataset. The images were first processed using a Gaussian filter then due to class imbalance I converted the data into a binary. Then, a custom CNN model was created for classification.
No image augmentation techniques were applied. the validation accuracy came out to be 96.1% and the accuracy came out to be 99.92% after 20 epochs.
